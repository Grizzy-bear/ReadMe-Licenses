======================


Collect all kinds of agreements, and gradually supplement the description of the agreements.

---------------------------------


###    GNU GPL
GNU General Public Licence (GPL) is probably the most commonly used licensing model in the open source world. GPL guarantees the rights of all developers and provides users with sufficient rights to copy, distribute and modify:
- Free replication
    You can copy the software to your computer, your client's computer, or anywhere. There is no limit on the number of copies.
- Free distribution
    Offer downloads on your website, copy to a U drive, or print out the source code and throw it out of the window (for environmental reasons, please don't do that).
- Can be used for profit
    You can charge for distributing the software, but you have to provide your customers with the GNU GPL license agreement for the software before charging, so that they can know that they can get the software free of charge from other sources and the reason for your fee.
- Free to modify
    If you want to add or delete a function, no problem, if you want to use part of the code in other projects, no problem, the only requirement is that the project using this code must also use the GPL protocol.

It should be noted that when distributing, source code and binary files need to be provided explicitly. In addition, some protocols for certain programs have some problems and limitations. You can see the article Practical Guide to GPL Compliance written by @Pierre Joye. With the GPL protocol, you must include the corresponding information in the source code, as well as the protocol itself.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

###    GNU LGPL

GNU also has another protocol, called LGPL (Lesser General Public Licence), which reserves fewer rights for products than GPL. In general, LGPL is suitable for open source libraries or frameworks for non-GPL or non-open source products. Because of the requirement of GPL, products using GPL code must also use GPL protocol. Developers are not allowed to use GPL code for commercial products. LGPL circumvents this limitation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### BSD

BSD has fewer restrictions on software distribution than other open source protocols such as GNU GPL. There are many versions of the protocol, the most important one is two versions, the new BSD protocol and the simple BSD protocol, which are both compatible with GPL and approved by open source organizations after modification.
The new BSD agreement (clause 3 agreement) has no restrictions on software distribution except for the need to include a copyright notice and a disclaimer. In addition, the agreement also prohibits endorsement of derivatives in the name of the developer, but the simple BSD protocol deletes this clause.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### MIT

The MIT protocol is probably the easiest of the major open source agreements. The core clauses are:
The software and related documents are free to all and can be disposed of at will, including use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, re-authorize, or sell. The only restriction is that the software must contain the above copyright and license hints.
This means:
- You can use it freely, copy it, modify it, and use it for your own projects.
- It can be distributed free of charge or used for profit.
- The only restriction is that the license declaration must be included.

The MIT protocol is the most relaxed of all open source licenses and has no restrictions except that it must contain a license declaration.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Apache

Apache 2.0 is the most suitable protocol for developers involved in patent content, in addition to providing users with copyright licenses, compared with other open source protocols (this article addresses this issue).
Apache protocol has the following points to explain:
- Permanent rights
    Once authorized, permanently owned.
- Global rights
    Authorization in one country applies to all countries. If you're in the United States, the license is licensed from India, no problem.
- Free authorization without royalties
    There is no cost in the early and late stages.
- No exclusiveness of authorization
    Anyone can be authorized
- irrevocable authorization

Once authorized, no one can cancel it. For example, if you develop a derivative based on the product code, you don't have to worry about being banned from using the code one day.

There are some requirements in the distribution of code, mainly to give recognition to the participants in the development in the declaration and to include a license agreement original.
